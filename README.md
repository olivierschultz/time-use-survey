### Summary

Access to data is increasing exponentially, yet our ability to analyze and make sense of them is limited. The goal of information visualization is to provide users with the tools necessary to visually explore, understand, and communicate complex data. 

The goal of this project was to create a fully-functional interactive information visualization. This consists of several components: understanding the user of the visualization, what kinds of tasks he or she is trying to perform with the visualization, what is his or her background and expertise, and what kind of data we’re dealing with.

For this project, we chose American and European Time Use Data - How people spend their time depending on country and sex, with activities such as paid work, household and family care, etc.

In this project, we developed a high-quality, interactive visualization that showcased your own interesting ideas.

We were interested in exploring how an average European and American spends their time, how much do they spend on each activity and which activities take up the most time.

### TUS & ATUS

In this project, we used two different data sets :

*   « European Time Use Survey » from Eurostat, 
*   « American Time Use Survey » from BLS.

Time use surveys (TUS) measure the amount of time people spend doing various activities, such as paid work, household and family care, personal care, voluntary work, social life, travel, and leisure activities.
More information at: [TUS](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tus_esms.htm)

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) measures the amount of time people spend doing various activities, such as paid work, childcare, volunteering, and socializing.

### Objectives

*   Visualize duration activities throughout the day in Europe and America.
*   Compare people's habits in different countries in Europe and America.
*   Explore how do people spend their time doing various activities bases on gender, day of the week, time in Europe and America.

### Quickstart

[Download](https://github.com/olivierschultz/time_use_survey/releases/tag/v1.0) the project or clone this repository and build on what is included in the `app` directory.
